# TASK AWAY (Sopra Group 07)

## Introduction

TASK AWAY is a chore management app designed for shared living spaces. It helps teams assign, track, and complete household tasks through a shared interactive pinboard. The task assignment system is flexible, supporting various distribution methods: First-Come-First-Serve (default), Karma’s Hand (based on progress), and Lucky Draw (randomized allocation). To boost motivation, the app incorporates gamification—users earn XP and level up by completing tasks. Calendar integration (via Google Calendar API) keeps everyone on track, while promoting teamwork and transparency.
